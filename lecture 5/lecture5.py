# FRACTIONS

# What does the decimal fraction 0.abc mean?

# a*10^-1 + b*10^-2 + c*10^-3

# For binary representation, we use the same idea

# a*2^-1 + b*2^-2 + c*2^-3

# Or to put this in simpler terms, the binary representation of a decimal
# fraction f would require finding the values of a, b, c, etc. such that

# f = 0.5a + 0.25b + 0.125c + 0.0625d + 0.03125e + ‚Ä¶

# WHAT ABOUT FRACTIONS?

# How might we find that representation?

                         #  -----     --------    --------    -------  
# In decimal form: 3/8 = 0.|3|7|5| = |3*10^-1| + |7*10^-2| + |5*10^-3|
                         #  -----    --------    ---------   --------
 
                         

# Recipe idea: if we can multiply by a power of 2 big enough to turn into
# a whole number, can convert to binary, and then divide by the same power
# of 2 to restore

# 0.375 * (2**3) = 3 subscript 10  

# Convert 3 to binary (now 11 subscript 2)

# Divide by 2**3 (shift right three spots) to get 0.011 subscript 2

# BUT‚Ä¶

# If there is no integer p such that x*(2^p) is a whole number, then
# internal representation is always an approximation

# And I am assuming that the representation for the decimal fraction
# I provided as input is completely accurate and not already an
# approximation as a result of number being read into Python


# Floating point conversion works:
   
# Precisely for numbers like 3/8
# But not for 1/10

# One has a power of 2 that converts to whole number, the other doesn‚Äôt

# TRACE THROUGH THIS ON YOUR OWN

# WHY is this a PROBLEM?

# What does the decimal representation 0.125 mean

# 1*10^-1 + 2*10^-2 + 5*10^-3

# Suppose we want to represent it in binary?

# 1*2^-3        0.001


# How how about the decimal representation 0.1

# In base 10: 1 * 10^-1

# In base 2: ?

# 0.0001100110011001100110011... infnite!

# THE POINT?

# If everything ultimately is represented in terms of bits, we need to
# think about how to use binary representation to capture numbers

# Integers are straightforward

# But real numbers (things with digits after the decimal point) are 
# a problem

    # The idea was to try and convert a real number to an int by multiplying
    # the real with some multiple of 2 to get an int
    
    # Sometimes there is no such power of 2!
    
    # Have to somehow approximate the potentially infinite binary sequence
    # of bits needed to represent them


# FLOATS

# STORING FLOATING POINT NUMBERS
# #.#

# Floating point is a pair of integers

# Significant digits and base 2 exponent

# (1, 1) --> 1*2^1 --> 10 subscript 2 --> 2.0

# (1, -1) --> 1*2^-1 --> 0.1 subscript 2 --> 0.5

# (125, -2) --> 125*2^-2 --> 11111.01 subscript 2 --> 31.25

# Called "floating point" becuase location of decimal can "float" relative
# to significant digits


# 125 is 1111101 then move the decimal point over 2

# USE A FINITE SET OF BITS TO REPRESENT A POTENTIALLY INFINITE SET OF BITS

# The maximum number of significant digits governs the precision with which
# numbers can be represented

# Most modern computers use 32 bits to represent significant digits

# If a number is represented with more than 32 bits in binary, the number
# will be rounded

# Error will be at the 32^nd bit

# Error will only be on order of 2*10^-10

# 2^-32 is approx. 10^-10 pretty small number, isn't it?

# MORAL of the STORY

# Never use == to test floats

# Instead test whether they are within small amount of each other

# Need to be careful in designing algorithms that use floats

# APPROXIMATION METHODS


# LAST LECTURE

# Guess-and-check provides a simple algorithm for solving problems

# When set of potential solutions is enumerable, exhaustive enumeration
# guaranteed to work (eventually)

# It‚Äôs a limiting way to solve problems

# Increment is usually an integer but not always. i.e. we just need some
# pattern to give us a finite set of enumerable values

# Can‚Äôt give us an approximate solution to varying degrees

# BETTER than GUESS-and-CHECK

# Want to find an approximation to an answer

    # Not just the correct answer, like guess-and-check
    # And not just that we did not find the answer, like guess-and-check
    

# EFFECT of APPROXIMATION on our ALGORITHMS?

# Exact answer may not be accessible

# Need to find ways to get ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù answer

    # Our answer is ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù to ideal answer
    
# Need ways to deal with fact that exhaustive enumeration can‚Äôt test every
# possible value, since set of possible answers is in principle infinite    

# Floating point approximation errors are important to this method

# Can‚Äôt rely on equality!

# APPROXIMATE sqrt(x)

# FINDING ROOTS

# Last lecture we looked at using exhaustive enumeration/guess and check
# methods to find the roots of perfect squares

# Suppose we want to find the square root of any positive integer, or any
# positive number

# Question: What does it mean to find the square root of x?

# Find an r such that r*r = x ?

# If x is not a perfect square, then not possible in general to find an exact
# r that satisfies this relationship; and exhaustive search is infinite

# APPROXIMATION

# Find an answer that is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù

# E.g., find a r such that r*r is within a given (small) distance of x
# Use epsilon: given x we want to find r such that |ùëü^2 -x | < ùúÄ

# Algorithm

    # Start with guess known to be too small ‚Äì call it g
    # Increment by a small value ‚Äì call it a ‚Äì to give a new guess g
    # Check if g**2 is close enough to x (within ùúÄ)
    # Continue until get answer close enough to actual answer
    
    
# Looking at all possible values g + k*a for integer values of k ‚Äì so similar
# to exhaustive enumeration

    # But cannot test all possibilities as infinite


# APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM 

# In this case, we have two parameters to set

    # epsilon (how close are we to answer?)   
    # increment (how much to increase our guess?)
    
    
# Performance will vary based on these values 

    # In speed
    # In accuracy
    
# Decreasing increment size --> slower program, but more likely to get good
# answer (and vice versa)

# SOME OBSERVATIONS

# So didn‚Äôt exit loop as expected

# We have over-shot the mark

# I.e., we jumped from a value too far away but too small to one too far away
# but too large

# We didn‚Äôt account for this possibility when writing the loop
# Let‚Äôs fix that

# LET‚ÄôS FIX IT

x = 54321

while abs(guess ** 2 - x) >= epsilon and guess ** 2 <= x:
                                   # -------------------
                                   # Same condition as guess-and-check, stop
                                   # when you go past the last reasonable
                                   # guess

# BIG IDEA

# It‚Äôs possible to overshoot the epsilon, so you need another end condition

# SOME OBSERVATIONS

# Now it stops, but reports failure, because it has over-shot the answer

# Let‚Äôs try resetting increment to 0.00001

    # Smaller increment means more values will be checked
    # Program will be slower
    
# BIG IDEA

# Be careful when comparing floats.

# LESSONS LEARNED in APPROXIMATION

# Can‚Äôt use == to check an exit condition

# Need to be careful that looping mechanism doesn‚Äôt jump over exit test
# and loop forever

# Tradeoff exists between efficiency of algorithm and accuracy of result

# Need to think about how close an answer we want when setting parameters
# of algorithm

# To get a good answer, this method can be painfully slow.

    # Is there a faster way that still gets good answers?
    # YES! We will see it next lecture‚Ä¶.
    
# SUMMARY

# Floating point numbers introduce challenges!
# They can‚Äôt be represented in memory exactly

    # Operations on floats introduce tiny errors
    # Multiple operations on floats magnify errors :(
    
# Approximation methods use floats

    # Like guess-and-check except that
    # (1) We use a float as an increment
    # (2) We stop when we are close enough
    # Never use == to compare floats in the stopping condition
    # Be careful about overshooting the close-enough stopping condition
