# PYTHON CLASSES

# OBJECTS

# Python supports many different kinds of data

# 1234      3.14159      "Hello"      [1, 5, 7, 11, 13]

# {"CA": "California", "MA": "Massachusetts"}


# Each is an object, and every object has:
    
# An internal data representation (primitive or composite)

# A set of procedures for interaction with the object    

# An object is an instance of a type

    # 1234 is an instance of an int
    
    # "hello"is an instance of a str
    
    
    
# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)    
    

# EVERYTHING IN PYTHON IS AN OBJECT (and has a type)    
    
# Can create new objects of some type    
    
# Can manipulate objects

# Can destroy objects

# Explicitly using delor just ‚Äúforget‚Äù about them

# Python system will reclaim destroyed or inaccessible objects ‚Äì called
# ‚Äúgarbage collection‚Äù


# WHAT ARE OBJECTS?

# Objects are a data abstraction

    # that captures‚Ä¶


# (1) An internal representation

    # Through data attributes
    

# (2) An interface for

    # interacting with object


# Through methods (aka procedures/functions)

# Defines behaviors but hides implementation


# EXAMPLE:
    
# [1,2,3,4] has type list

# (1) How are lists represented internally?

# Does not matter for so much for us as users (private representation)


#                ------------------------------------------------------------
#          L =  |    1    |    2    |    3    |         |         |         |   
#               -----------------------------------------------------------

#      

#                  ------  --------         ------  -------         ------ --------         ------  -------
#    or    L =   |  1  | |  -->  |‚ö´Ô∏è-----‚ñ∂Ô∏é|  2  | |  -->  |‚ö´Ô∏è-----‚ñ∂Ô∏é|  3  ||  -->  |‚ö´Ô∏è-----‚ñ∂Ô∏é|  4  | |  -->  | 
#                ------  --------         ------  --------        ------ --------          -----  --------


# follow pointer to the next index


# (2) How to interface with, and manipulate, lists?


# L[i], L[i:j], +

# len(), min(), max(), del(L[i])

# L.append(),L.extend(),L.count(),L.index(),

# L.insert(),L.pop(),L.remove(),L.reverse(),

# L.sort()

# Internal representation should be private

# Correct behavior may be compromised if you manipulate internal 
# representation directly


# REAL-LIFE EXAMPLES

# Elevator: a box that can change floors

    # Represent using length, width, height, max_capacity, current_floor
    
    # Move its location to a different floor, add people, remove people
    
    
# Employee: a person who works for a company

    # Represent using name, birth_date, salary
    
    # Can change name or salary
    

# Queue at a store: first customer to arrive is the first one helped

    # Represent customers as a list of str names
    
    # Append names to the end and remove names from the beginning
    
# Stack of pancakes: first pancake made is the last one eaten

    # Represent stack as a list of str

    # Append pancake to the end and remove from the end


# ADVANTAGES OF OOP

# Bundle data into packages together with procedures that work on them
# through well-defined interfaces


# Divide-and-conquer development

    # Implement and test behavior of each class separately
    
    # Increased modularity reduces complexity
    
    
# Classes make it easy to reuse code

    # Many Python modules define new classes
    
    # Each class has a separate environment (no collision on function names)

    # Inheritance allows subclasses to redefine or extend a selected subset
    # of a superclass‚Äô behavior


# You write the class so you make the design decisions.


# You decide what data represents the class.

# You decide what operations a user can do with the class.    
    
# CREATING AND USING YOUR OWN TYPES WITH CLASSES    
    
# Make a distinction between creating a class and using an instance
# of the class  
    

# Creating the class involves

    # Defining the class name
    # Defining class attributes
    # for example, someone wrote code to implement a list class  
    
  
# Using the class involves

    # Creating new instances of the class
    # Doing operations on the instances
    # for example, L=[1,2]and len(L)    
  
    
# A PARALLEL with FUNCTIONS  
    
    
# Defining a class is like defining a function

    # With functions, we tell Python this procedure exists

    # With classes, we tell Python about a blueprint for this new data type    

        # Its data attributes
        
        # Its procedural attributes
        

# Creating instances of objects is like calling the function


    # With functions we make calls with different actual parameters  

    # With classes, we create new object tinstances in memory of this type      
        
        # L1 = [1,2,3]    
        
        # L2 = [5,6,7]

# Decide what data elements constitute an object

# A coordinate is defined by an x and y value        
        

# Decide what to do with coordinates

# Tell us how far away the coordinate is on the x or y axes

# Measure the distance between two coordinates, Pythagoras


# DEFINE YOUR OWN TYPES

# Use the classkeyword to define a new type



#    class                      class
#    definition   name/type     parent

#    --------  -------------  --------
#   | class | | Coordinate |(| object |):
#   --------  -------------  ---------

        # #define attributes here


# Similar to def, indent code to indicate which statements are part of the
# class definition

# The word objectmeans that Coordinateis a Python object and inherits all
# its attributes (will see in future lects) 
    

# WHAT ARE ATTRIBUTES?


# Data and procedures that ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to the class

# Data attributes

    # Think of data as other objects/variables that make up the class
    
    # for example, a coordinate is made up of two numbers
    
    
# Methods (procedural attributes)

    # Think of methods as functions that only work with this class

    # How to interact with the object
    
    # for example you can define a distance between two coordinate
    
    # objects but there is no meaning to a distance between two list
    # objects



# DEFINING HOW TO CREATE AN INSTANCE OF A CLASS


# First have to define how to create an instance of class
 
# Use a special method called __init__ data attributes or perform
# initialization operations   
    
    
# class Coordinate(object):

    

#
#                                         -----------------------
#                                        |                       |
#                                        |                       |
#                                        ‚ñº                       |
#          ------------  ------    -------------  
#     def |  __init__ |(| self |, | xval, yval |):       what data initializes a
#         ------------  -------   -------------          Coordinate object
#               ‚ñ≤          ‚ñ≤
#               |          | 
#               |          |
#                          ----------  
#        special method to           |
#        create an instance          |
#        __ is double underscore     |
#                                    |
#                                    |  
#                                    |
#                                   
#                parameter to refer to an instance of the      
#                class without having created one yet


#        ---------
#       | self.x | = xval
#       |        |
#       | self.y | = yval
#       ---------  
 
#           ‚ñ≤
#           |
#           |

#    two data attributes
#    make up your type   
    

# selfallows you to create variables that belong to this object

# ithout self, you are just creating regular variables!


# WHAT is self?

# ROOM EXAMPLE

# self is the blueprint's way of accessing attributes (data and methods)


# Think of the class definition as a blueprint with placeholders for
# actual items

    # self has a chair
    # self has a coffee table
    # self has a sofa
    
    
# Now when you create ONE instance (name it living_room), self becomes
# this actual object    
    
    # living_room has a blue chair
    # living_room has a black table
    # living_room has a white sofa


# Can make many instances using the same blueprint


# BIG IDEA


# When defining a class, we don‚Äôt have an actual tangible object here.

# It‚Äôs only a definition.

# Recall the __init__ method in the class def:
 
    
def __init__(self, xval, yval):
    
    self.x = xval
    
    self.y = yval
    

# ACTUALLY CREATING AN INSTANCE OF A CLASS    

# Don‚Äôt provide argument for self, Python does this automatically

#      -------------------
# c = | Coordinate(3, 4) |
#     -------------------

#     create a new object of type Coordinate
#     and pass in 3 and 4 to the __init__   


# origin = Coordinate(0,0)


# Data attributes of an instance are called instance variables

# Data attributes were defined with self.XXX and they are accessible with
# dot notation for the lifetime of the object

# All instances have these data attributes, but with different values!


#        ------
# print(| c.x |)
#       ------

#       use the dot notation to access 
#       an attribute of instance c 


# print(origin.x)


# VISUALIZING INSTANCES

# Suppose we create an instance of a coordinate

# c = Coordinate(3,4)

# Think of this as creating a structure in memory

# Then evaluating

# c.x

# looks up the structure to which c points, then finds the binding for x
# in that structure

# Procedural attribute

    # Think of it like a function that works only with this class

# BIG IDEA

# The . operator accesses either data attributes or methods.    
    
# Data attributes are defined with self.something    
    
# Methods are functions defined inside the class with selfas the first parameter.    
    

# THE POWER OF OOP    
    

# Bundle together objects that share   

    # Common attributes and    

    # Procedures that operate on those attributes
    
    
# Use abstraction to make a distinction between how to implement an object
# vs how to use the object    


# Build layers of object abstractions that inherit behaviors from other
# classes of objects
        
# Create our own classes of objects on top of Python‚Äôs basic classes
